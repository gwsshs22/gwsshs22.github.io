Hi there! I'm Geon-Woo Kim. I'm a Ph.D. student at UT Austin working under the guidance of [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/).
I received my Bachelor's degree from Seoul National University, where I was advised by [Prof. Byung-Gon Chun](https://bgchun.github.io/).
**My research interests lie in systems for machine learning**, with a recent focus on tackling the challenges of large-scale model training and inference.
Prior to beginning my Ph.D. program, I had the pleasure of working as a software engineer at [Viva Republica](https://toss.im/en), a startup that operates one of South Korea's largest fintech services.

Please see my [cv](assets/pdf/CV_Geon-Woo_Kim.pdf) for more details.
