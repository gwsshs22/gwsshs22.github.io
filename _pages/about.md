I'm an undergraduate student at Seoul National University working with [Prof. Byung-Gon Chun](https://bgchun.github.io/) as a research intern.
I am currently applying for doctoral programs pursuing an ML systems researcher.
My research goal is to build software that optimizes and orchestrates the execution of ML applications.
To this end, I have participated in [several research projects](#publications) presented at top CS conferences.

Before returning to the school, I also worked as a software platform engineer for nearly five years at [Viva Republica Inc.](https://toss.im/en), a leading fin-tech startup in South Korea [valued at over $7.4B with over 20 million users](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/viva-republica-developer-of-korean-financial-super-app-toss-raises-410m-at-a-7-4b-valuation/).
As an early member of the startup, I implemented over 20 financial services, built a fully equipped mobile marketing platform, and operated the infrastructure for machine learning and big data analysis.
